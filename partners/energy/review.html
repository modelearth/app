 	<h2>Activated Carbon Production Facility</h2>  

	<h4><b>Project Goal</b> - A facility design that generates more clean water, energy and air than it consumes.</h4>

	The images below convey the scale of the building and the option for solar rooftops. 
	Local&nbsp;Brunswick&nbsp;zoning&nbsp;allows up to 5 stories and could potentially be adjusted upward for special projects.<br><br>

		"The facility would be state-of-the-art and designed more like a micro-brewery than conventional carbon plants. All processing gasification and activation would take place indoors in a 100,000 sq ft, environmentally controlled building." - Nat&nbsp;Mundy<br><br>

		<b>Structural Objectives:</b><br>
		Hurricane wind-resistant building&nbsp;profile.<br>
		Tsunami-resistant concrete pilings below columns.<br>
		Use of affordable, locally sourced wood products.<br>

	<b>Suggested modifications to images above</b><br>
	Incorporation of pathways, leasable pastures and fast-growth forestry space.<br>
	5-story container storage areas for complimentary production facilities and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA).<br>
	Multiple smaller buildings with frontages to make space more dynamic and inviting.<br>
	Use of transparent wood on exterior frontages surrounding main building envelope.<br>
	Use of solar panels to provide shade canopies over parking and outdoor meeting areas.<br>
